# sbt-sass-compiler

This is a SBT plugin to compile CSS from Sass files.

`sbt-sass-compiler` is built on [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/). It is intended as a replacement for
[sbt-sassify](https://github.com/irundaia/sbt-sassify), which uses the deprecated [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass/)
implementation.
